## Project Description

FORTRAN and Racket programs designed to solve different types of mathematical problems using numerical methods. The problems solved are the following:

- Non-Linear Equations
- System of Linear Equations
- Numerical Interpolation
- Regression
- Numerical Integration
- Differential Equations
  
Each implementation has its own methods, which will be in the ReadMe of the corresponding folder.

## Use Cases

Modern-day problems require modern-day solutions. Many engineering-related problems consist of systems involving complex equations or tedious formulas that represent a bottleneck in an engineer's workflow. There are areas such as process engineering that would benefit from this system, because, with fast algorithms and the capability to input a lot of data from files the time consumed in calculations becomes minimal.
