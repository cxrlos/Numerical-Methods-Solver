# Circle spiral and fractal drawing using Racket 

![Demo](Demo.gif)

## 1. Authors

## 2. Context

Fractals are as beautiful to see as they are helpful in different scenarios. They are a relevant case study in the field of mathematics, as they are able to represent complex landscapes such as mountain ranges, or even create a visualization of the spread of bacteria.

## 3. Project Description

The project's objective is to study how fractals are constructed, due to its recursive nature.

### 3. 1 Spiral

TBD

### 3. 2 Fractal

## 4. Topics

1. **File IO**
    - To make various processing requests for many figures
2. **Functional Programming**
   - Due to the figures that we want to draw, functional programming makes sense as a solution to the problem
3. **Recursion**
    - Because of the recursive nature of fractal figures and other types of figures, functional programming is an option that makes sense

## 5. Use Cases

The program serves as a study to analize behaviour of fractals contruction, and to deepen knowledge on recursion and its applications

## 6. Dependencies

- Racket
- drracket

## 7. Running the program

In  the main file (TBD)
