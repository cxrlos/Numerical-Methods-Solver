## Project Description
FORTRAN and Racket programs designed to solve different types of mathematical problems using numerical methods. The problems solved are the following:

- Non-Linear Equations
- System of Linear Equations
- Numerical Interpolation
- Regression
- Numerical Integration
- Differential Equations
  
Each implementation has its own methods, which will be in the ReadMe of the corresponding folder.
