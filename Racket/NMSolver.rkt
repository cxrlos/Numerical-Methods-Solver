    |   Purpose: Serves as the main function, reads the file from the 
    |       .txt input file and then runs the Gillespie algorithm through
    |       the described graph. Throughout the script there are multiple
    |       functions that are described in the following lines.
    |
    |   Functions:
    |       main() - Main driver function
    |       menu() - Runs the selection menu.
    |       readGraph() - Reads the .txt file.
    |       nodeCoordinates() - Based on the number of nodes, it assigns a
    |           set of coordinates for each node.
    |       setRandomInfected() - Sets a random number of nodes to be 
    |           infected and randomly chooses nodes to set the respective
    |           status.
    |       gillespie() - Runs the Gillespie algorithm over the graph. The
    |           inputs are the following: the graph, recovery rate (gamma),
    |           initial infections and max number of iterations for the
    |           simulation.
    |       getAtRisk() - Calculates if a node is next to an infected
    |           neighbor.
    |       getInfected() - Calculates if a node is infected.
